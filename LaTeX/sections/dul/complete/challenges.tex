    Why is unsupervised learning challenging?
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{-0.3em}
        \item \textbf{Lack of labeled data}: \\ We don't have labels or answers to guide us—it's like solving a puzzle without a picture.
        \item \textbf{Difficult to assess performance}: \\ It's hard to know if our results are good, since there's nothing to compare them to.
        \item \textbf{Sensitivity to noise}: \\ The algorithms can get confused by noisy or unusual data points.
        \item \textbf{Curse of dimensionality}: \\ When there are too many features, it's tough to find real patterns—the data gets too spread out.
        \item \textbf{Interpretability issues}: \\ The results can be hard to understand or explain, making it tricky to use them effectively.
