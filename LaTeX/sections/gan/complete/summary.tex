    \LARGE GANs: \textbf{Summary}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instead of explicitly learning data probability distribution. Learn it implicitly.
    \item Train two networks jointly. Generator generates fake samples and aims to fool discriminator. Discriminator aims to discriminate between real and fake samples.
    \item GANs are notoriously difficult to train. Lots of tips and tricks available.
    \item Huge amount of research done on GANs and plenty of variations with interesting results.
\end{itemize}
