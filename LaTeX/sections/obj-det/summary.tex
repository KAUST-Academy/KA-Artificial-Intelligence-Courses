\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Object Detection: Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Object detection is a complex task that involves identifying and localizing objects within images.
    \item Key challenges include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Variability in object appearance, scale, and orientation.
        \item Occlusion and clutter in images.
        \item Real-time processing requirements for applications like autonomous driving.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Techniques range from traditional methods like sliding windows to advanced deep learning approaches like YOLO and Faster R-CNN.
    \item Intersection over Union (IoU) is a critical metric for evaluating the accuracy of object detection models.
    \item YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm that processes images in a single pass, making it efficient for applications requiring speed.
\end{itemize}
