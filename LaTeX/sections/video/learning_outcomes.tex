    By the end of this session, you will be able to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define video data and temporal concepts.
        \item Identify challenges in acquiring and processing video.
        \item Implement models from single-frame CNNs to spatio-temporal Transformers.
        \item Extract motion features and recognize actions.
        \item Apply self-supervised video representation learning.
        \item Connect vision and language using CLIP and zero-shot.
        \item Build generative models: VQ-GAN, StyleCLIP, Diffusion.
        \item Critically assess limitations and propose future research.
    \end{itemize}
