\begin{frame}[t,allowframebreaks]{Instance Discrimination \& Contrastive Learning }
    \textbf{Pretext Task Evolution:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Earlier: handcrafted tasks (e.g., jigsaw, colorization).
        \item Now: contrastive learning directly optimizes for invariance and discrimination.
        \item Leads to better, more transferable features and narrows the gap with supervised learning.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Instance Discrimination:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Treats each image as its own class.
        \item Positive pairs: augmented views of the same image.
        \item Negative pairs: views from different images.
        \item Promotes invariance to augmentations and discrimination between instances.
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{0.5em}

    \textbf{Contrastive Learning:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Self-supervised approach for learning representations, especially in vision.
        \item Uses data structure instead of labels.
        \item Learns by pulling together similar (positive) pairs and pushing apart dissimilar (negative) pairs using a contrastive loss (e.g., InfoNCE).
    \end{itemize}
