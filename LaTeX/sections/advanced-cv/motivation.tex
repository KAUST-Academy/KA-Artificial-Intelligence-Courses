    \large Why this topic matters:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Traditional CNNs struggle with sequential and long-range dependencies.
            \item RNNs were a start, but they come with their own baggage.
            \item Attention mechanisms and Transformers revolutionized NLP â€“ now transforming vision tasks.
            \item Vision Transformers (ViTs) are outperforming CNNs on many benchmarks.
            \item \textit{"Understanding the Transformer is a must for any modern deep learning practitioner."}
        \end{itemize}
