    By the end of this session, learners will be able to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Understand how vision and text can be jointly modeled.
        \item Explore state-of-the-art models such as CLIP and diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) methods.
        \item Implement and evaluate image and video captioning systems.
        \item Grasp classifier-free guidance and text-conditioned generation techniques.
        \item Analyze the limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions.
    \end{itemize}
