\begin{frame}{Data leakage}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cross-validation: training set is split into training and validation sets for model selection
        \item Incorrect: Scaler is fit on whole training set before doing cross-validation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Data leaks from validation folds into training folds, selected model may be optimistic
        \end{itemize}
        \item Right: Scaler is fit on training folds only
    \end{itemize}
