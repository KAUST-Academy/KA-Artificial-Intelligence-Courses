\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) address the limitations of traditional feedforward networks 
    in processing sequential data such as text, speech, and time series. Their ability to capture 
    temporal dependencies makes them essential for various applications:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Machine Translation:} Converting sentences between languages.
        \item \textbf{Time-Series Prediction:} Forecasting stock prices using GRU/LSTM architectures.
        \item \textbf{Image Captioning:} Generating textual descriptions from images using CNN-RNN hybrids.
    \end{itemize}
