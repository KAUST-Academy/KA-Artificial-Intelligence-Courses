\section{Motivation DQN}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Why DQN? (Motivation)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Tabular Q-learning does not scale} to large or continuous state spaces.
        \item \textbf{Function approximation} is needed to generalize across similar states; deep learning provides powerful tools for this.
        \item \textbf{Deep Q-Networks (DQN)} combine Q-learning with deep neural networks, enabling reinforcement learning for high-dimensional inputs such as images.
        \item \textbf{Breakthrough:} DQN achieved human-level performance on Atari 2600 games directly from raw pixel inputs.
