\begin{frame}{Learning Outcomes}
By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the ViT architecture and patch embedding process.
    \item Discuss optimization challenges and solutions (e.g., distillation).
    \item Contrast CNNs vs ViTs in terms of inductive bias, data efficiency, and performance.
    \item Describe hierarchical models (e.g., Swin) and detection frameworks (DETR).
    \item Understand ConvNeXt as a modern CNN influenced by transformer insights.
    \item Recognize current limitations and deployment considerations.
\end{itemize}
