    \begin{itemize}
        \item Text-to-SVG generation is a novel application of diffusion models, enabling the creation of vector graphics from textual descriptions.
        \item The process involves training a diffusion model to learn the distribution of SVG images conditioned on text prompts.
        \item The model generates SVG paths, which are inherently vector-based and scalable without loss of quality.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Using SDS loss is not limited to text-to-3D.
        \item SDS provides a general way to backpropagate and learn through any differentiable “rendering” pipeline.
