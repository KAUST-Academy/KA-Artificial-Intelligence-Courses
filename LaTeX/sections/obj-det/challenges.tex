\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Object Detection: Challenges}
\textbf{Object detection} is a complex task in computer vision that involves identifying and localizing objects within images.

Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, object detection requires both identifying the objects present and determining their locations within the image.

This task presents several challenges that make it more difficult than classification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multiple outputs:} Need to output variable numbers of objects per image
    \item \textbf{Multiple types of output:} Need to predict "what" (category label) as well as "where" (bounding box)
    \item \textbf{Large images:} Classification works at 224x224; need higher resolution for detection, often $\sim 800 \times 600$
\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Complexity of Objects}: Objects can vary in size, shape, and appearance, making it difficult to create a one-size-fits-all detection model.
%     \item \textbf{Occlusion}: Objects may be partially hidden by other objects, complicating detection.
%     \item \textbf{Variability in Lighting and Background}: Changes in lighting conditions and complex backgrounds can affect detection accuracy.
%     \item \textbf{Real-time Processing Requirements}: Many applications require real-time detection, which demands efficient algorithms.
%     \item \textbf{Class Imbalance}: Some classes may have significantly more training examples than others, leading to biased models.

% \textbf{Additional Challenges}:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Annotation Challenges}: Creating accurate bounding box annotations for training data can be time-consuming and error-prone.
%     \item \textbf{Generalization to New Environments}: Models trained on specific datasets may not perform well in different environments or with unseen object variations.
%     \item \textbf{Scalability}: Scaling detection models to handle large datasets or multiple classes can be challenging.
%     \item \textbf{Evaluation Metrics}: Choosing appropriate metrics for evaluating detection performance, such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and mean Average Precision (mAP), can be complex.
%     \item \textbf{Adversarial Attacks}: Object detection models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations in input images lead to incorrect detections.
