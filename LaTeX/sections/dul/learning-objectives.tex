\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Supervised learning} requires large labeled datasets, which are often unavailable in real-world scenarios.
        \item \textbf{Deep Unsupervised Learning} enables discovery of hidden structures, patterns, and representations in data \textbf{without labeled outputs}.
        \item Systems can learn autonomously from vast amounts of raw, unstructured data.
        \item Understanding unsupervised methods (clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection) helps:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unlock insights missed by supervised approaches
            \item Reduce dependency on human annotation
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
