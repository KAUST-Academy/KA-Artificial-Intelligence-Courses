\begin{frame}{Limitations of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Sample inefficiency}: Requires a large number of interactions with the environment to learn effectively.
        \item \textbf{Stability issues with function approximation}: Training with neural networks can be unstable and sensitive to hyperparameters.
        \item \textbf{Sparse or delayed rewards}: Learning is difficult when rewards are infrequent or delayed.
        \item \textbf{Requires careful reward design}: Poorly designed rewards can lead to unintended behaviors.
        \item \textbf{Poor generalization across tasks}: Policies often do not transfer well to new or slightly different tasks.
