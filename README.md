# LaTeX Project Build Script

This repository contains a Bash script to compile LaTeX (`.tex`) files into PDFs using `latexmk`. It supports building either all LaTeX files in the project or a specific one, and moving the output to a designated directory.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```

project-root/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.sh           # The build script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lectures/          # (Default) Output directory for generated PDFs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LaTeX/             # Directory containing .tex source files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file1.tex
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file2.tex
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- `latexmk`
- A working LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live or MiKTeX)
- Bash shell

## üöÄ Usage

From the root directory, run the build script:

### Compile All `.tex` Files

```bash
./build.sh
````

This compiles **all** `.tex` files in the `LaTeX/` directory and moves the resulting PDFs to the `Lectures/` folder.

### Compile a Specific File

```bash
./build.sh --file filename.tex
```

Replace `filename.tex` with the name of the LaTeX file (located inside the `LaTeX/` directory) you want to compile.

### Specify an Output Directory

```bash
./build.sh --output CustomOutputDir
```

You can combine this with the `--file` flag:

```bash
./build.sh --file filename.tex --output CustomOutputDir
```

## üßπ Cleanup

The script automatically cleans up auxiliary files generated during the build process, such as `.aux`, `.log`, `.toc`, etc.

## ‚ùó Notes

* All LaTeX source files **must be located in the `LaTeX/` directory**.
* If the specified file does not exist, the script will exit with an error.
* If no `--file` is provided, the script will default to building all `.tex` files.

---
To ensure your commit messages are properly parsed by tools like `conventional-changelog` and accurately reflected in your changelog, it's essential to adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This structured format not only facilitates automated changelog generation but also aids in semantic versioning.

### ‚úÖ Conventional Commit Message Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

* **`type`**: Indicates the nature of the change. Common types include:

  * `feat`: A new feature
  * `fix`: A bug fix
  * `docs`: Documentation changes
  * `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  * `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  * `perf`: Performance improvements
  * `test`: Adding or correcting tests
  * `chore`: Maintenance tasks (build process, auxiliary tools, libraries)

* **`scope`** *(optional)*: Provides additional contextual information, typically the name of the affected module or component, enclosed in parentheses.

* **`description`**: A concise summary of the change, written in the imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update").

* **`body`** *(optional)*: A more detailed explanation of the change, its rationale, and any relevant background information.

* **`footer(s)`** *(optional)*: Additional metadata, such as issue references or notes about breaking changes.

### üõ† Examples

#### 1. **Adding a New Feature**

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
```

*Adds a new feature to the authentication module.*

#### 2. **Fixing a Bug**

```
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception on user creation
```

*Fixes a bug in the API module related to user creation.*

#### 3. **Documentation Update**

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

*Updates the installation instructions in the README.*

#### 4. **Code Refactoring**

```
refactor(database): optimize query performance
```

*Refactors database queries for improved performance.*

#### 5. **Performance Improvement**

```
perf(image-processing): reduce image loading time
```

*Improves the performance of image loading in the image-processing module.*

#### 6. **Test Addition**

```
test(auth): add unit tests for login functionality
```

*Adds unit tests for the login functionality in the authentication module.*

#### 7. **Chore Task**

```
chore(deps): update dependency versions
```

*Updates project dependencies to their latest versions.*

#### 8. **Breaking Change**

If a commit introduces a breaking change, indicate it by adding an exclamation mark (`!`) after the type or scope, and include a `BREAKING CHANGE` footer:

```
feat(auth)!: remove legacy authentication methods

BREAKING CHANGE: The legacy authentication methods have been removed. Users must now use OAuth2.
```

*Introduces a breaking change by removing legacy authentication methods.*

### üîó Linking to Issues

To associate commits with issues, include references in the footer:

```
fix(auth): correct password reset link

Resolves: #123
```

*Fixes issue number 123 related to password reset links.*

### üìå Tips for Effective Commit Messages

* **Use the imperative mood**: Write as if you're giving a command (e.g., "add feature", not "added feature").
* **Be concise**: Keep the subject line under 50 characters if possible.
* **Provide context**: Use the body to explain the "why" behind the change.
* **Consistent formatting**: Maintain a consistent structure to facilitate automated tools.

By following the Conventional Commits specification, you ensure that your commit messages are clear, consistent, and machine-readable, enabling efficient changelog generation and semantic versioning.
