    \begin{itemize}
        \item Understand and implement \textbf{Deep Q-Networks (DQN)}.
        \item Grasp the \textbf{SARSA algorithm} and how it contrasts with Q-learning.
        \item Analyze the \textbf{differences between off-policy and on-policy learning}.
        \item Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms.
        \item Understand practical applications and limitations of DQN and SARSA.
