\begin{frame}{Normalizing Flow Models - Summary}
\textbf{Key Takeaways:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalizing flows provide a powerful framework for modeling complex distributions with exact likelihoods.
    \item They transform simple base distributions into complex data distributions using invertible mappings.
    \item The change of variables formula and the Jacobian determinant are central to their mathematical foundation.
    \item Architectures such as NICE, RealNVP, and Glow illustrate the evolution and increasing sophistication of flow-based models.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are trade-offs between model expressiveness and computational efficiency.
    \item Designing transformations with tractable Jacobians is crucial for efficient learning and density estimation.
