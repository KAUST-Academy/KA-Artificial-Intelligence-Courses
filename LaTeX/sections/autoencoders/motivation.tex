\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Real-world data is often \textbf{large}, noisy, and difficult to interpret.
        \item We aim to \textbf{compress} data efficiently while preserving essential information.
        \item It is also valuable for machines to \textbf{generate} new, realistic data samples.
        \item \textbf{Autoencoders} are a type of \textbf{unsupervised learning} model that address both compression and generation tasks.
        \item They \textbf{learn} to represent data in a \textbf{lower-dimensional space}, capturing its most important features.
