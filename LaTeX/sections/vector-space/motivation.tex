        \item Text is symbolic; machines require numerical representations to process it.
        \item Classical NLP struggled with sparse, high-dimensional vectors.
        \item Vector Space Models (VSMs) and Word Embeddings represent words in a continuous vector space.
        \item These models capture semantic meaning and relationships geometrically.
        \item Basis for modern NLP methods including Transformers.
