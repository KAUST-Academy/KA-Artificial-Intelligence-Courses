\begin{frame}{On-Policy vs. Off-Policy Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On-Policy}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agent learns by doing.
        \item Follows one policy for both acting and learning.
        \item Example: Tries out actions, learns from its own experience.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Off-Policy}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agent learns from others or past experiences.
        \item Can follow one policy but learn about another.
        \item Example: Watches someone else, learns what would have happened if it acted differently.
