\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Data transformations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Machine learning models make a lot of assumptions about the data
        \item In reality, these assumptions are often violated
        \item We build pipelines that transform the data before feeding it to the learners
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Scaling (or other numeric transformations)
                  \item Encoding (convert categorical features into numerical ones)
                  \item Automatic feature selection
                  \item Feature engineering (e.g. binning, polynomial features,...)
                  \item Handling missing data
                  \item Handling imbalanced data
                  \item Dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA)
                  \item Learned embeddings (e.g. for text)
              \end{itemize}
        \item Seek the best combinations of transformations and learning methods
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Often done empirically, using cross-validation
                  \item Make sure that there is no data leakage during this process!
              \end{itemize}
