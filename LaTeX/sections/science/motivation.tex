\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Generative AI for Science: Motivation}
\textbf{Where We Are}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generative AI is helping scientists make new discoveries faster.
    \item We use it for things like designing proteins, finding new medicines, and predicting the weather.
    \item Some popular tools are AlphaFold (for proteins), Earth-2 (for climate), and SMILES (for chemicals).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Where We Are Going}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generative AI could help us solve big problems and understand complex systems.
    \item As AI gets better and computers get faster, we can do even more with these tools.
    \item We need to use AI responsibly and think about the impact on society.
\end{itemize}
