    \textbf{Where We Are}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Drug discovery is the process of finding new medicines.
        \item It involves identifying potential drug candidates, testing them, and bringing them to market.
        \item Traditional methods are slow and expensive, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Where We Are Going}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generative AI can speed up drug discovery by predicting how molecules will behave and interact.
        \item AI can analyze large datasets to find patterns and suggest new drug candidates.
        \item This could lead to faster development of new treatments for diseases.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Understand how generative AI integrates into the drug discovery pipeline (e.g., SMILES $\rightarrow$ molecules $\rightarrow$ optimization).
        \item Recognize real-world successes of generative AI in drug discovery.
        \item Identify current challenges and hurdles in applying generative AI to this field.

    \textbf{Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Synthetic feasibility}: Not all AI-generated molecules can be easily synthesized in the lab.
        \item \textbf{Lab validation}: Experimental validation is required to confirm predicted properties and efficacy.
        \item \textbf{Regulatory barriers}: Approval processes for new drugs are lengthy and complex.
        \item \textbf{Data bias}: Training data may not represent all relevant chemical space, leading to biased predictions.
        \item \textbf{Model collapse}: Generative models can produce limited diversity or converge to trivial solutions.
    \end{itemize}
