After this session, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the principles behind latent space diffusion (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
    \item Summarize score-based diffusion models and their significance.
    \item Explain PDE-based approaches to diffusion modeling.
    \item Outline methods for fine-tuning diffusion models for specific tasks.
    \item Utilize text-conditioned diffusion models for controlled image generation.
    \item Apply classifier-free guidance to steer diffusion model outputs.
\end{itemize}
