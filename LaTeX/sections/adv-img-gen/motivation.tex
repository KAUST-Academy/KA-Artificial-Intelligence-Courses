\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been the dominant approach for image generation.
        \item However, GANs can be difficult to train and often suffer from issues like mode collapse.
        \item Diffusion models offer a new approach that avoids these pitfalls by modeling the data distribution through a gradual denoising process.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Advanced Image Generation Models}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Why it matters:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Diffusion models are reshaping creativity, art, and design.
            \item From AI avatars to realistic landscapes, they have endless applications.
            \item You'll gain insight into how these models work --- and how to use them yourself!
