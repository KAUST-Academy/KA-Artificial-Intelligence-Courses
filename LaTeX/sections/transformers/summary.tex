\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transformers use self-attention to capture relationships within sequences.
        \item Self-attention allows each token to attend to all other tokens, enabling context-aware representations.
        \item Positional encoding is crucial for maintaining the order of tokens in the sequence.
        \item Masked self-attention prevents future information leakage during training.
        \item Multi-head attention enhances model capacity by allowing multiple attention mechanisms to learn different aspects of the data.
