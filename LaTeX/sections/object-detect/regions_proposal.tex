    \LARGE Object Detection: \textbf{Regions Proposal}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Regions Proposal}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find a small set of boxes that are likely to cover all objects
        \item Often based on heuristics: e.g. look for “blob-like” image regions
        \item Relatively fast to run; e.g. Selective Search gives 2000 region proposals in a few seconds on CPU
    \end{itemize}
