\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Learning the Speediness in Videos}
    \textbf{Learning Speediness} is a self-supervised learning approach that focuses on understanding the temporal dynamics of videos by learning to recognize or reconstruct videos at different playback speeds.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Speed Variation:} The model learns to predict or reconstruct video frames at various speeds, enhancing its understanding of temporal relationships.
        \item \textbf{Applications:} Useful for tasks like action recognition, video summarization, and temporal segmentation.
        \item \textbf{Goal:} To learn robust representations that capture the dynamics of video data across different temporal scales.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Ultimate Goal:} Watch video content faster by adaptively speeding up the video
