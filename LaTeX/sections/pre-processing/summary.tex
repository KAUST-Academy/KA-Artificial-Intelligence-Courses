\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data preprocessing is a crucial part of machine learning
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Scaling is important for many distance-based methods (e.g. kNN, SVM, Neural Nets)
        \item Categorical encoding is necessary for numeric methods (or implementations)
        \item Selecting features can speed up models and reduce overfitting
        \item Feature engineering is often useful for linear models
        \item It is often better to impute missing data than to remove data
        \item Imbalanced datasets require extra care to build useful models
    \end{itemize}
    \item Pipelines allow us to encapsulate multiple steps in a convenient way
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Avoids data leakage, crucial for proper evaluation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Choose the right preprocessing steps and models in your pipeline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cross-validation helps, but the search space is huge
        \item Smarter techniques exist to automate this process (AutoML)
    \end{itemize}
