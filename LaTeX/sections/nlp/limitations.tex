\begin{frame}{Limitations}

NLP has come a long way, but there are still some big challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bias:} Models can pick up and even increase unfairness from the data they learn from.
    \item \textbf{Needs Lots of Data:} Modern NLP needs huge amounts of labeled text, which is hard and expensive to get.
    \item \textbf{Ambiguity:} Language can be confusing! For example, ``I saw the man with the telescope''â€”who has the telescope?
    \item \textbf{Many Languages:} It's tough to make models that work well for every language, especially those with little data.
    \item \textbf{Expensive to Train:} Training big models costs a lot of money and energy, so not everyone can do it.
\end{itemize}
